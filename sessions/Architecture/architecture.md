# General notes for architecture session

This session is a talk. There are two versions; one for technically minded people (coders who are familiar with content mining), and one for non-technical or general audiences.

## General version

This will likely be the more commonly used version of this session. It will cover the basics of crawling, scraping, and extracting, and depending on the session length, will include coverage of the challenges

## Technical version

This will be more suited to those already familiar with the technical aspects of content mining, for example those who are contributing to our software during hack days.
