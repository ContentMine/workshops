# Getting AMI

## Running with the ContentMine VM *recommended*

If we are using a VM, AMI will already be installed and ready to use. In this case, you can move on to [using AMI](ami_basics). If you need help accessing the VM, there should be instructions on the VM section of the workshop, or you can follow the instructions in the [VM repo](https://github.com/ContentMine/vms/blob/master/installation_intructions.md).

## Alternative installation

To install AMI directly onto your own machine you can grab one of the nightly builds from [Jenkins](https://jenkins.ch.cam.ac.uk/job/ami-plugin). We will soon update this document with more straightforward instrictions for specific operating systems below.
