# Getting AMI

If we are using a VM, AMI will already be installed and ready to use. In this case, you can move on to [using AMI](ami_basics). If you need help accessing the VM, there should be instructions on the VM section of the workshop, or you can follow the instructions in the [VM repo](/ContentMine/vms/blob/master/installation_intructions.md).
