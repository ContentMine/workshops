# Notes on software session

- currently there are two versions of the software slides (long and short)
- do not use the long version in an event where the aboutus slides are being used since there is significant overlap
- the long version would be a good introduction to a hackday so that a general intro to the project is not needed
- the short version would be better suited to a general content mine workshop/event
