### Workshop Purpose
Example [here](https://github.com/ContentMine/CambridgeChemistryWorkshopSep2015)

How can the workshop solve a problem of the participants?
```Ever found that the key data you want is published in a text-based PDF journal? 
* ...found yourself manually downloading 100 papers click-by-click?
* ...redrawing structures/spectra/graphs so you can recompute/analyze them?
* ...retyping data from tables?
* ...wishing that a computer can do the really boring discovery and retrieval of the data in the literature?

We all have. But new approaches are solving it. That's why Content-Mining (aka text-and-data mining, TDM) is one of the most
exciting areas in scientific data. 
It's even been intensively debated in the European Parliament and Commission. And the UK is leading the way with new exemptions 
from copyright so that Universities like Cambridge are the ideal places to learn and develop the new techniques.```

What will we do in the workshop?
```The workshop will bring together:
* scientists with a need to discover data, especially in chemistry, materials, molecular bioscience - both experimental and computational
* scientific publishers
* library staff
* technology developers.```

What are we going to learn?
```We'll show how Open software can be used to
* crawl the literature effectively using search APIs
* scrape all the content from publisher web pages (supplemental data, structures)
* normalize PDFs into semantic HTML
* run search plugins to discover particular.
```

How is this organized, who is behind that?
```The first day will include overviews, installation of technology [1], and a panel of experts from the participants on policy
and practice and a hands-on introduction.
The second day will be a project-based hack where small groups will tackle their own communal problems.
The event is sponsored by the EPSRC-IAA Knowledge Transfer Fund of the Chemistry Department. Facilitators are from Chemistry and Plant Sciences. 
Coffee, lunches and a Friday dinner are provided. 

[1] all essential technology is Open and from contentmine.org, an Open project funded by the [Shuttleworth Foundation.](https://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/)```

### Intended Audience
<!--- e.g.
This two day event is intended for researchers or research-related staff who are not currently heavily involved in text and data mining but have at least some pre-existing computational skills. At minimum we expect familiarity with a command line interface and basic coding abilities in some language.  -->
