# General materials for ContentMine workshops

*If you are running a ContentMine workshop, please read through this document and use the resources in this repo.*

Welcome to the ContentMine workshops repo! This repo is designed to support members of the ContentMine team in designing and implementing a ContentMine workshop or hack event. However the materials found here can also be used by anyone who is interested.

## Organisation of this repo

### Folder: organisation

This folder contains resources related to the organisation of a workshop. Currently this includes:
- checklist.md
  - a markdown file that can be converted into an issue on GitHub
  - this checklist is a general list of things to do when you are setting up, running, and assessing a workshop
- template_README.md
  - a markdown file that can be used as the README for the specific workshop repo
  - this should be made, and details (venue, date, hashtag *etc.*) filled in ASAP
- template_programme.pages and template_programme.docx
  - Pages or MS Word template for generating the workshop programme - you can use either
  - it may also help to look at programmes from previous workshops:
    - [Force2015](https://github.com/ContentMine/force2015_workshop/raw/master/info/force15programme.pdf)
    - [EBImine](https://github.com/ContentMine/ebi_workshop_20141006/raw/master/info/EBI_programme.pdf)
  
### Folder: sessions

*Please note: this directory is currently being developed. Please let me (Steph) know if you need any specific materials, and be aware that I will be updating and adding material frequently.*

This folder contains sub-directories for each session that we run. The full list of our sessions, and their descriptions can be found in the README of the sessions folder. The repo for your specific workshop can be populated with a selection of resources from here. Roughly, the directory is organised into categories:

- handouts
  - materials to print for use on the day for specific events
- talks (folders with the prefix talk_...)
  - pdf slides for various talks
  - originals were made in keynote and dropbox links will be provided here eventually
  - conversions to powerpoint will be provided here eventually
  - a ContentMine slideshare account will be opened, and the slides will be uploaded there eventually (and linked from here)
- demos (folders with the prefix demo_...)
  - pdf slides for non interactive demos (mainly screenshots)
  - handouts for interactive demos - assuming participants have access to a machine with internet
