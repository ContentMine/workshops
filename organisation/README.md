  - this can be converted into a github issue and be used as a to do list throughout the planning and execution of the workshop
- `template_programme`
  - this can be edited to make a programme for the day with the ContentMine theme. There are Pages and MS Word versions for Apple/Office users
- `template_README.md`
  - this can be copied and pasted as the README for the new workshop repo. It will need to be filled with the relevant information for the specific workshop.
